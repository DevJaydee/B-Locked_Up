			<h666> AS3 Vector2 Projects </h666>
        <p>
          We were assigned to make multiple little projects with a custom Vector2 file, <br>
          the first few projects were to get us to better know Actionscript and Animate. <br>
          <br>
          The final assignment was to make a game with the custom Vector2 Class. <br>
          My idea was to make a game similair to Touhou (Bullet Hell, Shoot-Em-Up). <br>
          <br>
          I kinda succeeded, but since collsions are so fun to work with, I kinda stopped trying to waste my time, <br>
          and work on other important projects. <br>
					<br>
					Anyway, here's a little synopsis for my game. (keep in mind, this game is in early-alpha)<br>
					<br>
					In a alternate dimension. Where everything excist out of shapes, you play as a Triangle, trying to avoid falling squares, <br>
					And make it through to the end. <br>
					Your goal is to save other Triangles, and many other shapes <br>
					Since the Squares are the evil once who are trying to take over the 2D World. <br>
